Shields and Props: The Adventurers Museum

#DinustyMuseumChallenge #DinustyChallenge
Aand its done. :D 
We've just concluded the DiNusty Adventurers Museum challenge, and what a blast it was. :D

I was already working on a big environment project and couldn't commit to making a hero asset for the museum. But my friends at DiNusty needed help with some secondary props and making something together sounded fun. 

The most notable one was probably the shield. Each shield is a Bluperint that uses 1 ARD Material for base, 1 pattern trim + Damage layer and, 1 LUT texture. The BP picks patterns and colours by randomizing UV offset.

Aside from that I also made some filler props, 3 different speaker types and vents.

It was a great pleasure to contribute to this project

Big thanks go to Joel Planas, Artur Olestsik, Jeremy Estrellado, and everyone that participated in this challenge. :)
