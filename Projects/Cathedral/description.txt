Medieval Cathedral
---
With this environment I am planning to showcase the medieval building techniques the medieval builders employed in these mega-projects across Western Europe. :) For the time being the project is on pause, but i am very much looking forward to getting back to it. For my research on the topic i've read several books, the notable ones being: Cathedral Builders by Jean Gimpel and Sir Banister Fletcher's global history of architecture. Really recommend both. :)
