  "title": "Spas 12 Remake - Rust",
  "description": "I had about a week or so of \"free time\" in between assigned tasks so i decided to remake the old spas model we were using in Rust. I felt like we needed to have a refresh. So here we are. It was super fun going into a lot of detail on the model, especially on the internal parts and coming to a better understanding how it worked. Sadly, they discontinued the spas model - it's such an iconic weapon.",
