  "description": "This was for one my previous hackweeks. I really loved the idea of being able to pick these consoles off of dead scientists that you come across in Rust and to be able to find and collect more games across the map.\r\nConcept and design process by me in a week. Wish i had more time for this!\r\nPixel art originally done by https://twitter.com/ArkhaiPxls",
