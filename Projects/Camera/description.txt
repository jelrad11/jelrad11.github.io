Twin-Lens Camera
---
This Twin-Lens Camera, known as the "Lubitel" (Amateur), was manufactured in the Soviet Union during the 1950s. It was heavily inspired by the German "Voigtl√§nder Brilliant", and in 1960s, a chinese variant was created titled "Changle".

With this project, I aimed to improve my texturing skills in Substance Painter. I had an old 3D model of this camera in my digital "drawer" and decided to repurpose it. The original mesh was unfortunately very heavily subdivided, so the majority of the production time was spent on cleanup and improving the silhouette.
I modeled the bag anew to give the prop a more life. The bag, aside from the straps, is fully rigged.
I also utilized some Quixel assets to build up the surrounding scene.
Big thanks to all the Dinusty Discord community members and my friends who provided me with feedback throughout the process.
